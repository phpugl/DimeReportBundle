# Dime - ReportBundle

The report bundle should visualize the timeslices of the activities in a certain time range and maybe put some nice 
charts. It will be the first example implementation to extend the DimeTimetrackerFrontendBundle.

## General Proposal

Dime is a time tracker based on Symfony2. It provide an REST API and this Bundle will be the Frontend for it. At the 
moment we use Bootstrap as HTML framework and Backbone.js as rest client.

## Requirements

- DimeTimetrackerBundle
- DimeTimetrackerFrontendBundle

## Configuration

    config.yml
    
    imports:
        - ...
        - { resource: "@DimeReportBundle/Resources/config/config.yml" }

## Initialization

    app/console dime:init --dev
